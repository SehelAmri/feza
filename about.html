    FEZA, which is standing with a motto Be Better Educated, believes that a good nation will stand strong if her people are embodied with good education.

A person with better education will be a source of light illuminating the nation. FEZA aims to light every door of the house with the light of education by giving scholarships to the needy one whether in Feza Schools or Community schools to support the slogan of our Father of nation who said that our big enemies are ignorance, diseases and poverty (adui ujinga, maradhi na umasikini). Ignorance is a prime factor of the other two enemies, diseases and poverty.

FEZA schools logo consists of two features, a black bow bending downward which looks like a foetusin a womb of its mother. This is the stage where all human being has to pass in the process of foetus development, the dark bowed feature represents a human being.

So, FEZA logo expresses that human being needs better education in order to grow and serve our beautiful nation, Tanzania. Be Better Educated.
